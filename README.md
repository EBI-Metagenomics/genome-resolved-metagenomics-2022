# Metagenomics bioinformatics (Virtual) - 2021

Learn about the tools, processes and analysis approaches used in the field of metagenomics.

This course will cover the use of publicly available resources to manage, share, analyse and interpret metagenomics data; including marker gene, whole gene shotgun (WGS) and assembly-based approaches.

The virtually-delivered content will involve participants learning via pre-recorded lectures and live presentations, followed by live Q&As with the trainers. Practical experience will be developed in group activities and in computational exercises run in Docker containers on our virtual training infrastructure.
